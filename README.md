Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

      

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.

Use webpack --watch to enable webpack watch for file changes
